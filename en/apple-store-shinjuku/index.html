<p>Today, Apple Store Shinjuku is opened.</p>
<h2 id="high-five-parade">High five parade</h2>
<p>It was 9:45 when I arrived at the storefront. It was 15 minutes before opening time, but I was just on time for the start of the staff&rsquo;s high five parade.</p>
<p>From within the store, people wearing Apple staff t-shirts came trailing out in one line. They called out &ldquo;Yay!&rdquo; to the people who had been watching the situation inside the store while reaching out their hands for high fives.</p>
<p>At any rate, there were many people. The staff of easily over a hundred continued to shout &ldquo;Yay!&rdquo; extremely cheerfully.</p>
<p>After moving forward to some extent, they would do a U-turn and come back, and when they returned, they still had the same energy.</p>
<p>In other words, if you were to return the high five even once, you would keep high fiving more than 100 people x 2 times. What a terrible trap.</p>
<p>Among them, some were so overcome with emotion that they would even hug.</p>
<p>I thought without a doubt that all of them had high energy, but on further observation, I realied that they ranged from those who said &ldquo;Yay!&rdquo; as if they were shouting, all the way to those who said &ldquo;Yay&rdquo; in a pretty embarrassed manner, and so there were as many &ldquo;Yay&quot;s as there were staff.</p>
<p>There was just one of them that shrieked &ldquo;Kiyay!&rdquo;. When it came to that one, I did not really understand.</p>
<h2 id="line-over-1000ft-long">Line over 1000ft long</h2>
<p>The line continued to the stairs to the subway next to the store, so it was a long line that continued for over 1000ft across the premises.</p>
<p>Despite having this number of people, there were no problems. Garbage was regularly collected by staff members, and they did the minimum necessary to not block passageways, so there weren&rsquo;t people who strayed too far from the line.</p>
<p>I lined up in the last stretch, five minutes to opening, and it took about an hour and a half to come up above ground. I guess there were lots of people, so it cannot be helped.</p>
