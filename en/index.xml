      <description>I go to Shinjuku Gyoen several dozen times each year. It&amp;rsquo;s a place where I can enjoy the change of seasons, something that can be difficult to experience in urban areas.
The cherry blossoms in spring, the grassland of summer, and the maple leaves during autumn each have their own charm. However, in January, I was able to view a world of white—a snowscape—when snow was falling heavily.</description>

      <description>Today, Apple Store Shinjuku is opened.
High five parade It was 9:45 when I arrived at the storefront. It was 15 minutes before opening time, but I was just on time for the start of the staff&amp;rsquo;s high five parade.
From within the store, people wearing Apple staff t-shirts came trailing out in one line. They called out &amp;ldquo;Yay!&amp;rdquo; to the people who had been watching the situation inside the store while reaching out their hands for high fives.</description>

      <description>I had many encounters with entertainment in 2016.
Musics Frederic WANIMA KANA-BOON Aimer ASA-CHANG &amp;amp; Junray Tama Motoharu Sano Yutaka Ozaki Kyu Sakamoto Yutaka Ozaki is wonderful. His lyrics latch onto the hearts of junior and high school students.
I was especially moved by &amp;ldquo;Sotsugyou (Graduation)&amp;rdquo;. He sings about both the clear and the vague feelings of confinement that students feel from their teachers and society, and after instilling feelings of empathy, he says, &amp;ldquo;that all ends once you graduate.</description>
