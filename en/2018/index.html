<p>I don&rsquo;t remember exactly when I first started thinking about it, but I&rsquo;ve always wanted to write a novel that would be commercially published.<br>
Thinking it was about time to start writing little by little, I began writing a novel intermittently from September 2017.<br>
This year, I&rsquo;m thinking of submitting it to a newcomer award competition.</p>

<h1 id="line-emoji">LINE Emoji</h1>
<p>When I heard that anyone could now sell LINE emoji, I started creating them. My first set went on sale on 12/31.</p>
<a href="https://store.line.me/emojishop/author/822719" target="_blank">Creator Page</a>
<p>LINE&rsquo;s Creators&rsquo; Stamps started in 2014, but at the time I was still a student. Since I hadn&rsquo;t studied art, I felt somewhat reluctant to create them just because they were popular, so I ended up not trying.</p>
<p>I genuinely liked LINE emoji, and had always wanted to create them if Creators&rsquo; Emoji ever became available, so I was able to start working on them naturally.</p>
<p>I was particularly interested in creating fonts. I think it&rsquo;s fun to be able to sell characters I&rsquo;ve created.</p>
<p>Generally, selling fonts is extremely labor-intensive. For Japanese, JIS Level 1 (2,965 characters) and Level 2 (3,390 characters) kanji are often required, and selling with fewer characters requires creative marketing strategies - either way, it&rsquo;s difficult.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s wonderful that LINE emoji only requires 265 characters including hiragana, katakana, and alphanumeric characters. For a while, there will likely be many handwritten-style fonts since they&rsquo;re easier to create, but I believe that over time, unique letterforms as well as Gothic and Mincho styles will start to increase.</p>

<p>I bought a camera on impulse without properly researching the market price, so I ended up paying quite a high price for it.</p>
<p>The next day, there was heavy snowfall in Shinjuku.</p>
<p>I walked around in the snow-covered landscape, constantly pressing the shutter, and through beginner&rsquo;s luck, I managed to take a few good photos, which got me completely hooked.</p>
<p>After that, I kept taking random photos wherever I went during my travels, but when I looked back at them later, they were terrible. I realized I needed to start seriously with classroom learning.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still struggling just to shoot landscapes horizontally, but I want to keep improving little by little.</p>

<p>I went to TK from Ling Tosite Sigure&rsquo;s year-end acoustic live performance.</p>
<p>It was my first acoustic live, and even though the slightest touch of the strings resonated throughout the hall, the performance had the stability of listening to a CD. I thought, &ldquo;Professionals are amazing&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was extremely happy to hear my favorite song, Showcase Reflection.</p>

<p>The talks about blockchain game development were fascinating.</p>
<p>Since blockchain itself is just a technology, blockchain games are being used in various ways.</p>
<p>While everyone is still in the exploratory phase, I think the public is most interested in blockchain games as a means of mining.</p>
<p>Although ICOs are currently volatile, if mining were to take place on a gaming platform, I think it could bring about different changes.</p>
