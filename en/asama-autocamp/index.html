<p>I went camping at Asama-en Auto Campground.</p>
<p>As far as I can remember, this was my first time camping since childhood.</p>

<p>We departed from Saitama by car. At first, the countryside scenery like this continued,</p>

<p>but after about 2 hours, we were in the mountains.</p>
<p>As expected of Karuizawa. The trees are orderly, and you can feel the attention to detail in creating the landscape.</p>

<p>Shiraito Falls. It&rsquo;s small for a waterfall, but it was full of nature and felt refreshing.</p>
<p>In front of the campground, there was a volcano museum.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a place where you can learn about Mount Asama, which is a volcano, but there&rsquo;s also an emergency food restaurant where, as the name suggests, you can eat emergency food, and there are nature walking trails.</p>
<p>The nature walking trails had extremely beautiful scenery.</p>
<p>I took a ton of photos, but they were all ruined because there was dust on my camera. It was a good learning experience.</p>

<p>For some reason, they were also selling bonsai. And at quite reasonable prices too.</p>

<p>The campground.</p>
<p>Interestingly, groups with more elaborate camping gear tend to take more prominent spots, which naturally improves the overall appearance of the campground.</p>
<p>Since June is the perfect camping season, almost all spots were taken.</p>
<p>The campground was filled with the sounds of frogs croaking and motorcycles drifting.</p>
<p>Asama-en is also known as a holy land for motorcycle riders. Though you can&rsquo;t see them from the campground, you could tell from the sounds that quite a few people were racing motorcycles during the day.</p>

<p>My first time smoking food.</p>
<p>Starting the fire was difficult, but things like sausages and cheese are easy to smoke.</p>

<p>Curry. This was probably my first time cooking rice in a mess tin since elementary school. Back then, I couldn&rsquo;t do it well and have memories of struggling to chew hard rice with uncooked cores.</p>
<p>This time I was nervous going in without practice, but it was easy to make since the water amount and the color when cooked were not much different from using a rice cooker.</p>

<p>According to the person who took me camping this time, the real charm of camping starts after sunset.</p>
<p>I completely agreed. Conversations around the campfire were nice, and if you went a little away from the campground, it was very quiet and the stars were beautiful.</p>

<p>Before leaving, I tried a hot air balloon ride (3000 yen per ride).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not good with heights so I couldn&rsquo;t keep my eyes open at all, but watching the balloon rise from below was a good experience.</p>
