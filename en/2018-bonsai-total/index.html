      <p>This is a compilation of works I created during this year at the bonsai and bonkei classes I&rsquo;ve been attending since last December.</p>
<p>Initially, I was such a plant novice that I could only recognize cherry blossoms when looking at plants, but I&rsquo;ve come to identify several species now.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;ve come to understand a glimpse of the &ldquo;beauty&rdquo; of bonsai and bonkei&hellip; I think. Probably about 1 millimeter&rsquo;s worth.</p>
<h1 id="the-difference-between-bonsai-and-bonkei">The Difference Between Bonsai and Bonkei</h1>
<p>Bonsai involves planting a single species of plant. Any additions are limited to moss or small companion plants at most. What&rsquo;s important is how that single species is planted and cultivated.</p>
<p>Bonkei involves planting several types of plants. The characteristic is expressing through the combination of species, spacing, and arrangement.</p>

<ul>
<li>Iwa-uchiwa (Shortia uniflora)</li>
<li>Shojobakama (Heloniopsis orientalis)</li>
<li>Ryu-no-hige (Ophiopogon japonicus - Mondo grass)</li>
</ul>
<p>Three species that grow in shade (Ryu-no-hige can also grow in sun).</p>
<p>This was my first bonkei that wasn&rsquo;t a moss ball, and since it didn&rsquo;t go very well, the teacher mostly did it for me.</p>
<p>Perhaps because my balcony was sunny, or maybe I overwatered them, everything except the Ryu-no-hige died rather quickly. The path is steep&hellip;</p>

<p>Apparently, species tulips that haven&rsquo;t been bred for improvement have become popular again recently.</p>

<div class="article-body">
<ul>
<li>Dwarf Rhododendron</li>
<li>Dokudami (Houttuynia cordata)</li>
</ul>
<p>I missed April due to other commitments, but the teacher made this for me.</p>
<p>The photo was taken after the blooming period, but it produced beautiful purple bell-like flowers.</p>
<p>Since it was in a shallow pot with mounded soil for good drainage, when I watered it the same as the others, the dwarf rhododendron couldn&rsquo;t withstand this year&rsquo;s intense heat and died&hellip;</p>
<p>Later, the teacher replaced the dwarf rhododendron with baby&rsquo;s breath. I&rsquo;m relieved that this one has successfully made it through the year.</p>

<li>Tsukushino Wild Rose</li>
<li>Ibuki Thyme</li>
<li>Nikko Otome Hosta</li>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t attend in May either, so the teacher made this for me.</p>
<p>I was surprised by how impressive the composition was.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sand Moss (Racomitrium canescens)</li>
<li>Mountain Moss</li>
</ul>
<p>This was the session for planting moss. While it looks simple, planting bit by bit with tweezers was quite difficult.</p>
</div>
<div class="figure">
	<img src="/images/2018-bonsai-total/06-01.jpg">
</div>
<div class="article-body">
<p>Mountain moss seems easy but actually has quite a lot of variation, making it extremely challenging to arrange evenly.</p>
<p>Also, sand moss falls apart easily if you don&rsquo;t grab it correctly.</p>
<p>As a bonus, I received a variegated Sedum (Chuban Misebaya).</p>
<p>Both sand moss and Misebaya grow well with good sunlight. If they&rsquo;re in a place that gets rain, they barely need water.</p>
<h1 id="july">July</h1>

<div class="article-body">
<ul>
<li>Variegated Spindle Tree</li>
<li>Yakushima Keibiran (Cymbidium)</li>
</ul>
<p>I was told that Keibiran is difficult to grow because the leaves fall easily, so I was relieved to successfully raise it.</p>
<p>I was shocked when forgetting to water for just one day on a hot day caused an entire branch&rsquo;s worth of leaves to wither instantly. They fall off with just a slight lift, so it&rsquo;s quite challenging.</p>
<p>About 30% of the leaves remained even at the end of autumn, allowing me to enjoy the autumn colors for a long time.</p>

<div class="article-body">
<ul>
<li>White Egret Orchid (Habenaria radiata)</li>
</ul>
<p>This session was mainly lecture-based. Not just about egret orchids, but about growing and ecology of bulbous plants in general.</p>
</div>
<div class="figure">
	<img src="/images/2018-bonsai-total/08-01.jpg">
</div>
<div class="article-body">
<p>Apparently, this is a variety called &ldquo;Hisho&rdquo; (Flight).</p>

<ul>
<li>Japanese Beautyberry (Callicarpa japonica)</li>
<li>Kamazuka (Asian serviceberry)</li>
<li>Sakhalin Stonecrop</li>
<li>Dewgrass</li>
</ul>
<p>Though not visible in the photo, the tall Japanese beautyberry with its purple berries is beautiful.
I was amazed by the strength of bamboo roots. Apparently, no matter what else withers, bamboo stays vigorous.</p>

<ul>
<li>Red-flowered Variegated Daimonji</li>
<li>Variegated Eupatorium</li>
<li>Cardinal Flower (Lobelia cardinalis)</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve forgotten which was mine, but I think it was the left one.</p>
<p>Autumn is chrysanthemum season. The Eupatorium has flowers that look like tuna, which is interesting.</p>
<p>From this month, having the teacher do things for me was reduced to just final touch-ups. I&rsquo;m happy about that.</p>
<p>Still, I&rsquo;m just at the very beginning of the path of bonsai and bonkei.</p>

<ul>
<li>Mountain Chive (Allium thunbergii)</li>
<li>Ashizuri Chrysanthemum</li>
<li>Blue Sky Chrysanthemum</li>
</ul>
<p>I was surprised to plant chives as bonkei since I thought they were just for eating. They had a very strong chive smell.</p>
<p>Since they&rsquo;re quite tall, they look nice displayed in a room when receiving guests.</p>

<p>Bonus:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ardisia japonica</li>
<li>Mountain Moss</li>
</ul>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t attend the last class of the year&hellip; The teacher made it for me.</p>
<p>Since it&rsquo;s pine-bamboo-plum (a traditional lucky combination), I had my parents display it when I visited home for New Year&rsquo;s. The plum blossoms began blooming around January 5th and peaked on the 12th.</p>
