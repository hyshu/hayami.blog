<p>Today, we launched the AITuber Project at zoome LLC.</p>
<a href="https://aituber.net/" target="_blank">https://aituber.net/</a>
<p>This is a suite of services aimed at realizing VTubers powered by AI (artificial intelligence).</p>
<h1 id="the-journey-to-creating-aituber">The Journey to Creating AITuber</h1>
<p>The first idea that led to AITuber came to me in 2017 when iOS 11 was released with ARKit support for the first time.</p>
<p>At that time, VTubers were rapidly gaining attention.</p>
<p>Video streaming with 3D avatars and tracking was, for me as a programmer, an extremely interesting combination of technologies.<br>
I was intrigued that this was also being valued commercially, and I was thinking about what I could do in this space.</p>
<p>However, I quickly realized that VTuber success depends more on talent management and public relations than technical capability, making it a field where people with sales and PR backgrounds have the advantage.<br>
It became clear that it would be tough for a programmer to enter this field.</p>
<p>So I came up with the idea of an app that would let &ldquo;anyone become a VTuber.&rdquo;<br>
Unlike video, if you could send just the 3D model to smartphones, you&rsquo;d only need to send voice, coordinates, expressions, and body joint information, enabling lightweight streaming.</p>
<p>With ARKit&rsquo;s decent accuracy in detecting forward/backward and left/right movement, users could approach or view from different angles.</p>
<p>While I was developing this concept in my head, it seems many others had their eyes on the same opportunity. Several services appeared with almost identical selling points to what I had envisioned - letting anyone become a VTuber with less bandwidth than video.
Eventually, major companies began acquiring or entering this space, and my idea died in its embryonic stage.</p>
<p>Next, I thought about AITuber. This was around 2019, I think.</p>
<p>With the advancement of deep learning, the idea that we were entering the AI era had become established.<br>
VTubers were popular, AI was popular, so what about AI VTubers? I think this was a very natural progression.</p>
<p>Our company also started studying deep learning belatedly in 2020, and created <a href="https://honorific.app/" target="_blank">Keigo Translation</a> as an app that could leverage this knowledge. Since then, I had been saying internally that &ldquo;after Keigo Translation comes AITuber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By 2021, my resolve had solidified, so I acquired the domain aituber.net and reserved the app name on the App Store.</p>
<p>Now, searching for AITuber returns many results, but at that time there were only a handful.<br>
I believe this was due to the many technical challenges involved.</p>
<p>I also tried to create an AI VTuber, but there were two major challenges:</p>
<ol>
<li>What should the AI learn?</li>
<li>How to handle conversation?</li>
</ol>
<p>The first goal was of course to create an AI that moves and speaks as if there&rsquo;s a person inside, while being entertaining. But I needed to consider what training data to accumulate as a company asset.</p>
<p>As time passes, AI-related technologies advance and barriers to entry lower, making it harder to create unique strengths for our company.<br>
In this field where something you worked hard on can become meaningless in a day, this required even more careful consideration.</p>
<p>This hasn&rsquo;t changed much from when I first thought about it in 2021 to now, but it&rsquo;s dangerous to disclose before implementation, so I won&rsquo;t write about it here.</p>
<p>The second challenge of realizing &ldquo;conversation&rdquo; was a heavy burden and difficult to solve.</p>
<p>AI conversation could be created with predictive natural language models like BERT, but it&rsquo;s closer to selecting responses from pre-prepared sentences.<br>
While it&rsquo;s one approach, it alone wasn&rsquo;t sufficient.</p>
<p>Also, GPT-3, a generative large language model, was attracting attention, and the efforts of small companies like ours were likely to become futile.</p>
<p>In addition to these challenges, being entertainment meant people would easily migrate when something better appeared, making it difficult to enjoy first-mover advantages.</p>
<p>So while developing ideas, I was taking a wait-and-see approach, but then ChatGPT appeared - an AI service that far exceeded expectations - and the situation completely changed.</p>
<p>I started creating AITuber on March 31st last year.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-draw-aituber">How to Draw AITuber</h1>
<p>Naturally, the question arose of what to do about AITuber illustrations.</p>
<p>Even if I commissioned someone, I knew nothing about character design so I could only request &ldquo;something that looks good,&rdquo; and since I have at least minimal aesthetic sense to judge good from bad, I&rsquo;d want to request revisions until I was satisfied (definitely the worst kind of client).</p>
<p>While I can&rsquo;t draw, I do create vector format images for app icons and such (so-called vector art).<br>
The advantage of vectors is that once you draw a line, you can bend it repeatedly, so with time and trial and error, you can create something that looks decent.</p>
<p>Thinking I might manage somehow with the same approach, I spent about 4 months creating everything from illustrations to Live2D models, occasionally getting advice from friends who could draw.<br>
Live2D was my first time using it, but I thought it was interesting software that could do various things depending on how you use the parameters.</p>
<p>The most helpful series of articles was this:</p>
<a href="https://note.com/himono_vtuber" target="_blank">https://note.com/himono_vtuber</a>
<p>Front-facing drawings can be made symmetrical, and by finding the rules of human anatomy and common elements in these types of drawings, I somehow managed to create them.</p>
<h1 id="reason-for-the-name">Reason for the Name</h1>
<p>The reason for choosing the straightforward name &ldquo;AITuber Project&rdquo; is that the meaning of AITuber isn&rsquo;t unified.</p>
<p>While the term AITuber itself saw a surge in usage with the advent of ChatGPT, what specifically it entails hasn&rsquo;t been established.</p>
<p>This is because there&rsquo;s still limited capability.<br>
For example, VTubers can easily do game streaming if they have the streaming setup, but AITubers need to develop AI to play games.</p>
<p>Even for simple conversation, it&rsquo;s difficult to make statements based on past conversations, and getting consistent content requires considerable effort.</p>
<p>So while some people are trying to move 3D models with AI computational processing and have them speak with machine-generated voices, others are manually posting ChatGPT-generated dialogue on social media, and some just continuously publish AI-generated images of the same character - activities under the AITuber label vary greatly.</p>
<p>This means you need to go through three stages: &ldquo;AITuber agency or group name → what activities they do → AITuber character name.&rdquo;<br>
The order people learn about these varies, but either way it&rsquo;s long and confusing.</p>
<p>With the name &ldquo;AITuber Project&rdquo; and describing it as &ldquo;a project where everyone creates AITubers together,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s immediately clear that this is a user-participatory service.<br>
I think this is the best approach for now.</p>
<p>Of course, we won&rsquo;t trademark it (I don&rsquo;t think it would pass anyway), and it might not stay this name forever.</p>
<h1 id="ye-ling-ierin">Ye Ling (Ierin)</h1>
<p>I came up with the name &ldquo;Ie Rin&rdquo; when I was trying to write a novel from 2017-2019, thinking it would be interesting if the name and nickname matched, and decided to use it now that the time was right.</p>
<p>While creating the Live2D model, I learned that the onomatopoeia for bell sounds is written as &ldquo;ting-a-ling,&rdquo; so I made the English spelling of the given name &ldquo;Ling&rdquo; and changed the kanji to &ldquo;鈴&rdquo; (bell).</p>
<p>In English-speaking countries, writing Ie as &ldquo;Ie&rdquo; makes the pronunciation unclear, so I referenced DeepL and Google search&rsquo;s reading function and made it &ldquo;Ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The English word &lsquo;ye&rsquo; is archaic and apparently rarely seen outside of the Bible nowadays.<br>
Also, both &lsquo;Ye&rsquo; and &lsquo;Ling&rsquo; are apparently used when writing Chinese names in alphabets.</p>
<p>So it ended up becoming a mysterious name that works as a Japanese, English, and Chinese name.<br>
However, using &ldquo;yeling&rdquo; for Japanese SNS account IDs would be confusing, so I&rsquo;ll probably use &ldquo;ierin&rdquo; alongside it.</p>
<h1 id="toiro">Toiro</h1>
<p>Originally, we planned to start the service with two AITubers - Ye Ling and a male AITuber - but I judged that a male character was premature with current AI and stopped.<br>
I considered starting with just Ye Ling, but having two would expand the service&rsquo;s possibilities, so despite the tight schedule, I decided to create another.</p>
<p>I was anxious due to time constraints, but once I started creating, after about a week I thought &ldquo;Hey, this is looking pretty good?&rdquo; and it was well-received when I showed it to acquaintances.<br>
Since it took over a month for Ye Ling to reach that stage, this was a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>However, the back hair, eyes when moving the face left and right, and shoulder curves were difficult to make natural, so it still took about two months to complete.</p>

<p>Since &ldquo;AITuber Project&rdquo; is a long name, I used the vertically elongated font <a href="https://fontopo.com/?p=70" target="_blank">FONTOPO</a>.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a wonderful font with high visibility, playful yet not too pop.</p>
<p>However, two lines would be too vertically long, so I shortened &ldquo;Project&rdquo; by making the elliptical parts circular.</p>
<p>For colors, I made &ldquo;AI&rdquo; similar colors while trying various combinations for the others that were spread out but not too random.</p>
