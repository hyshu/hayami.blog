Here's a compilation of works created during my monthly bonsai and bonsai landscape classes throughout this year.

While last year focused mainly on bonsai landscapes, this year I moved on to a course on small bonsai (bonsai up to 15cm in height).

Next year, I'd like to try creating some on my own.

This year, several of my pots suffered devastating damage from the wind coming out of the air conditioner's outdoor unit.

Since I water them in the cool morning hours, I was slow to notice the problem. However, the outdoor unit in the afternoon produces what could be called gale-force winds, and even though I thought I had placed them at a sufficient distance, apparently the leaves and branches were still being stressed. It's frightening to think the same thing might have happened last year.

Next year, I truly want to have a bonsai life where nothing dies.

# January
{{< figure src="/images/2019-bonsai-total/01-00.jpg" title="" >}}

* Rock Pine (Iwamatsu)
* Miyama Azalea (Miyama Kirishima)

Rock Pine is a fern plant, so when combined with rocks it sticks to them and looks extremely cool.

Normally it stays dried and curled up as shown in the photo, but when you water it, the leaves open up the next day.

It's drought-resistant so you don't need to be too careful about watering, but sunlight is crucial and depending on placement, it might not survive the winter.

# February

* Fuji Cherry

Sadly, it apparently couldn't survive the intense midsummer heat.

I say "apparently" because, having switched from the alpine plants course to the bonsai course this year, I couldn't tell whether it had died or if the leaves had just fallen due to the season ending.

I kept thinking it was just because the season had ended, but after being taught how to identify dead trees and checking it later, it was definitely dead. Someday I'd like to try cherry trees again.

# March

* Maxillaria

A type of orchid. Planted in sphagnum moss, with nails hammered into driftwood and wrapped with wire or fishing line.

I was busy during this period and overslept, so my teacher made it for me. When I woke up, my alarm clock had been stuffed into my bonsai tool box.

# April
* Japanese Maple

I'll post photos later when the leaves come out and it's nicely arranged.

# May

* Chinese Elm (Nire Keyaki)

In summer, the branches grow vigorously, making pruning enjoyable.

In winter, all those leaves fall off spectacularly.

# June

* Opal
* Black Rose (Kurohoushi)
* Sempervivum

I forgot what the small bonus plant was.

I had wanted to try succulents, so I requested them and they were included as a subject for the class.

The combination was difficult since they're all completely different in size and shape.

# July

* Pine

A session on pine maintenance.

Through the process of turning a wildly overgrown pine prepared by the teacher into a proper bonsai, I learned what a terrible mess pines become without maintenance.

# August
{{< figure src="/images/2019-bonsai-total/08-00.jpg" title="" >}}

* Red Rosewood (Benishitan)
* Tiger-striped Liriope (Torafu Yaburan)

I was absent, so my teacher made this for me.

# September
{{< figure src="/images/2019-bonsai-total/09-00.jpg" title="" >}}

* Chirimen Vine (Chirimen Kazura)

Taking something with densely packed branches and leaves that looks bushy, reducing the leaves and spreading the branches with wire to make it into a beautiful bonsai.

Apparently my watering method was fundamentally wrong, and this one died quickly... Being a complete beginner with plants, this became an opportunity to think about watering.

# October
{{< figure src="/images/2019-bonsai-total/10-00.jpg" title="" >}}

* Ashizuri Chrysanthemum (Ashizurinogiku)
* Small Beach Chrysanthemum (Kohamagiku)

Learning the depth of chrysanthemums. Autumn means chrysanthemums.

Since they bloom spreading from a single stem, it's difficult to arrange them with other chrysanthemums or plants.

# December
{{< figure src="/images/2019-bonsai-total/12-00.jpg" title="" >}}

* White Rosewood (Shiroshitan)
* Purple Beautyberry (Murasakishikibu)
* October Stonecrop (Misebaya)

Just like last year, I was absent for the final class again.

My teacher made it for me. I received Misebaya as a bonus before too, and I like it.
