<p>COVID-19.</p>
<p>Since I had just started my company this year, I spent almost the entire year working from home, so I wasn&rsquo;t affected much. But if this had happened a few years earlier or later, it could have been a disaster.</p>
<p>We still can&rsquo;t see what lies ahead, so I want to stay vigilant.</p>
<h1 id="app-research">App Research</h1>
<p>I wrote last year about how I was constantly installing domestic iOS apps, and I was able to successfully publish an article on note.</p>
<p><a href="https://note.com/hyshu" target="_blank">https://note.com/hyshu</a><br>
(Note: When I migrated to Zenn in 2022, I deleted this as the information had become outdated)</p>
<p>That said, the work of continuously launching 3,000 apps was incredibly tedious, and it ended up taking until April.</p>
<p>This year, since I created an app for management purposes, I should be able to install over 10,000 apps. However, since I only started creating the app and the installation work around September, I have a feeling it&rsquo;s going to take about as long as last year.</p>
<p>Installing apps itself is extremely valuable as it allows me to see trends not only in the app industry but across the entire IT industry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also like to stabilize the process.</p>
<h1 id="books">Books</h1>
<ul>
<li>Understanding Manga History Through Manga / Eiji Otsuka</li>
<li>The Investment Philosophy of a Man Who Can Move the Nikkei Average by Himself / cis</li>
</ul>
<p>I started studying deep learning this year, so I read several reference books.</p>
<h1 id="company">Company</h1>
<p>zoome is currently developing a VR escape game, but it&rsquo;s proving difficult.</p>
<p>Since we couldn&rsquo;t see a clear path forward with this alone, I thought about whether we could create something using the deep learning I had been studying in parallel, which led to releasing the honorific translation app as mentioned in <a href="../honorific-converter/" target="_blank">the previous article</a>.</p>
<p>In zoome&rsquo;s <a href="../zoome/" target="_blank">founding article</a>, I had written at length about the VR escape game that was supposed to be the company&rsquo;s first product, but since the honorific translation was completed first, I deleted those sections. It&rsquo;s definitely not because I was embarrassed.</p>
<p>When we first founded the company, we only had plans for AR/VR business, but going forward, we plan to pursue business that includes deep learning as well.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve also come up with several ideas for the AR/VR business, so I want to continue creating things bit by bit, including the VR escape game, to accumulate know-how.</p>
