<p>From January to March, I was involved in a new app development project for a company founded by students.</p>
<p>The early-stage startup environment created by students was vastly different from what I had imagined, so I think I learned a lot.</p>
<p>Additionally, throughout the year, I installed iOS apps (excluding games) released in Japan and analyzed trends.</p>
<p>I installed about 3,000 apps, so after checking all of them including those I haven&rsquo;t launched yet, I plan to compile the research results into articles. I&rsquo;m planning to spend most of January on this.
(Later, I deleted apps that couldn&rsquo;t be used without being able to read English, so the actual number of apps surveyed was around 2,700)</p>
<p>From April to September, I devoted my time to founding zoome and preparing for it.</p>
<p>Since it was my first time starting a company, even tasks that seem simple now required a lot of research and were challenging at the time.</p>
<h1 id="novel-writing">Novel Writing</h1>
<p>This was also my first attempt, and it&rsquo;s indeed difficult - there&rsquo;s still a long way to go. I did submit an application though. I&rsquo;d like to continue this in the coming years.</p>
<h1 id="stocks">Stocks</h1>
<p>I thought it was time to start learning about stocks, so as part of that, I began trading public stocks.</p>
<p>I started in the latter half of this year, but stocks are basically structured in a way that makes it easy for beginners to lose money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to do casually without understanding how stock prices fluctuate, and somehow I ended up spending quite a bit of time on it for six months.</p>
<p>That said, I&rsquo;m glad I started because I can now understand to some extent the reasons behind stock price movements, which were completely incomprehensible when I had no knowledge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always enjoyable when things that seemed meaningless when you lacked knowledge become understandable. I ended this year in the red, so I&rsquo;d like to turn a profit by next year.</p>
<h1 id="music">Music</h1>
<p>I went to H ZETTRIO&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Day Special Live.</p>
<p>When you think of jazz live performances, they seem aimed at adults, but I was surprised to see children getting excited as if they were watching a hero show.</p>
<p>I had been deliberating for a long time about which music streaming service to choose, and I tried Spotify, which was excellent. It&rsquo;s currently my top choice.</p>
<p>Also, this year I became obsessed with Susumu Hirasawa (not related to Fuji Rock). I&rsquo;d love to go to a live performance.</p>
