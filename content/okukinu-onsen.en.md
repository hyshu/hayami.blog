Meotobuchi is located about an hour and a half by bus deeper into the mountains from Kinugawa Onsen.

This time, I went to a ryokan called Kaniyu, which is another 30 minutes away by shuttle bus from there.

First, getting to Kinugawa Onsen.

During the train journey, you can see lots of rice fields and mountains.

Arrived at Kinugawa Onsen Station.

Speaking of Kinugawa, it's famous for the Nikko Monkey Troupe, and they were performing.

Apparently, they were celebrating the first anniversary of the SL train operation, and there was quite a crowd.

I'm not particularly a fan of steam locomotives, but thinking that some people probably came specifically to see this ceremony, I felt it would be a waste not to watch, so I did.

The Kinutateiwa Suspension Bridge. It swayed a bit since it's a suspension bridge, which was scary.

After crossing the bridge, the path splits into a route that climbs the mountain and one that goes through a tunnel.

Under the tunnel was quite beautiful, especially since it had just rained.

After returning to the station, I took a bus heading to Meotobuchi Onsen.

Ichiryu-kaku ryokan that we passed along the way.

I heard this place is also popular, and apparently the hot spring water is clear.

Arrived.

There's a rest area near the entrance with an amazing atmosphere, featuring stuffed bears and deer, and armor. They must be real.

The river photographed from the room window. The water level is quite low, probably due to the consecutive days of extreme heat.

Kaniyu is characterized by its white, cloudy hot spring water, and the outdoor bath was particularly open and refreshing.

There are seven types of baths, including some with clear water.

Being deep in the mountains at this time of year, there were tons of insects. I'd like to go again in autumn or winter.

The cuisine made generous use of mountain delicacies and was very delicious. This is something unique to ryokans deep in the mountains.

On the return bus, we could see valleys and dams, which made for nice scenery.
