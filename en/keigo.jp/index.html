<p>To turn the honorific translation app into a &ldquo;learning honorific app&rdquo; as originally planned, I launched an explanatory blog and made it readable within the app.</p>
<a href="https://%e6%95%ac%e8%aa%9e.jp/" target="_blank">https://敬語.jp/</a>
<p>Due to various circumstances, I ended up writing the articles myself.</p>
<p>(This article is a reflection on approximately one year since launching &ldquo;Keigo.jp&rdquo; on January 16, 2022)</p>
<h1 id="the-ambiguity-of-honorifics">The Ambiguity of Honorifics</h1>
<p>Honorifics turned out to be more ambiguous than initially expected when starting the business, with impressions varying greatly between individuals even for the same honorific expressions.</p>
<p>Even expressions often heard as &ldquo;incorrect honorifics&rdquo; are considered clear linguistic corruption by some researchers, while others view and research them as new honorific expressions.
If I were to write considering all such various claims, the articles would become long and boring, with inconclusive conclusions.</p>
<p>After much consideration, I solved this by narrowing the target to &ldquo;when people in their teens to thirties use them with superiors in their forties to sixties.&rdquo;
This age gap is really when people struggle with honorifics, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<h1 id="the-current-state-where-theres-almost-no-way-to-learn-honorifics-correctly">The Current State Where There&rsquo;s (Almost) No Way to Learn Honorifics Correctly</h1>
<p>I first learned when launching the honorific business that in present-day Japan, it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to easily learn honorifics while avoiding so-called &ldquo;fake manners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you want to learn a proper honorific system, you should read either &ldquo;Keigo&rdquo; or &ldquo;Keigo Sainyumon&rdquo; by linguist Yasuhito Kikuchi, then read the Agency for Cultural Affairs&rsquo; &ldquo;Guidelines for Honorifics,&rdquo; but this seems too challenging for job-seeking students or new graduates to study.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Guidelines for Honorifics&rdquo; in particular, perhaps because many honorific researchers were involved, has contradictory explanations in places, making judgment difficult.</p>
<p>Also, articles found through web searches often explain that &ldquo;XX is wrong because it&rsquo;s double honorifics,&rdquo; but many actually include correct honorifics that aren&rsquo;t double honorifics, such as &ldquo;onegai itashimasu&rdquo; (I humbly request) or &ldquo;choudai itashimasu&rdquo; (I humbly receive).</p>
<p>In the first place, while double honorifics may be unnatural in modern times, they almost never cause the other party to become indignant, so they&rsquo;re not that important.</p>
<p>Rather, &ldquo;condescending language&rdquo; like saying &ldquo;haiken shite kudasai&rdquo; (please look [using humble form for yourself]) to someone else has a much higher risk of angering them, yet explanations of this are somehow scarce.</p>
<p>I also frequently see the lie that writing &ldquo;shite kudasai&rdquo; or &ldquo;shite itadaku&rdquo; with kanji characters is incorrect Japanese.</p>
<p>Thus, with so many articles explaining honorific manners that someone forcibly created to gain views, there&rsquo;s an absurd situation where the more earnest people who try to study by reading online articles, the more they memorize manners that are only commonly seen online.</p>
<p>What I personally find frightening is that these fake manners created by someone might someday become real manners.
Currently, there&rsquo;s no problem since more people think &ldquo;such manners don&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; but as ten or twenty years pass, they might become common sense, making already complicated honorifics even more troublesome.</p>
<p>Therefore, Keigo.jp aims to be a blog where people can easily learn the honorific system that has existed for a long time and is still valid today, based on the &ldquo;Guidelines for Honorifics&rdquo; and Mr. Kikuchi&rsquo;s books, while pointing out such fake honorific manners.</p>
<h1 id="articles-i-struggled-with-favorite-articles">Articles I Struggled With, Favorite Articles</h1>
<p>The article I struggled with most was about &ldquo;<a href="https://%e6%95%ac%e8%aa%9e.jp/%e3%81%95%e3%81%9b%e3%81%a6%e3%81%84%e3%81%9f%e3%81%a0%e3%81%8f" target="_blank">sasete itadaku</a>,&rdquo; which I rewrote many times over about four months.</p>
<p>This is because while the Agency for Cultural Affairs&rsquo; definition emphasizes the condition of &ldquo;having permission&rdquo; from traditional usage, most people today don&rsquo;t know this condition.
I myself didn&rsquo;t know this until I started the honorific business.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to explain that words we hear and see daily aren&rsquo;t actually being used correctly, and it&rsquo;s even more difficult to explain why it&rsquo;s better not to use them.
I think it&rsquo;s still hard to read, so I want to continue refining it.</p>
<p>My favorite article is &ldquo;<a href="https://%e6%95%ac%e8%aa%9e.jp/%e5%ae%9c%e3%81%97%e3%81%8f%e3%81%8a%e9%a1%98%e3%81%84%e8%87%b4%e3%81%97%e3%81%be%e3%81%99" target="_blank">Yoroshiku onegai itashimasu</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fake manner that says &ldquo;Writing &lsquo;Yoroshiku onegai itashimasu&rsquo; is incorrect and rude to the other party.&rdquo; If you search the web, many articles were written in 2017, so this manner apparently became popular around that time.</p>
<p>When I searched Google with date restrictions, the oldest article saying &ldquo;Yoroshiku onegai itashimasu&rdquo; is incorrect was from January 2016, and the oldest saying &ldquo;onegai itashimasu&rdquo; is incorrect was from January 2015.
(Strictly speaking, the oldest explanation that &ldquo;onegai itashimasu&rdquo; is incorrect is from an article in September 2014, but this is excluded as it was limited to official documents)</p>
<p>Just a light investigation of novels in Aozora Bunko shows it&rsquo;s been a commonly used writing style for decades. So it&rsquo;s obvious that this is a manner someone fabricated, but I was also fooled for a while.</p>
<p>Before writing this article, I researched over a hundred articles using web searches for &ldquo;yoroshiku onegai itashimasu,&rdquo; &ldquo;yoroshiku onegai itashimasu rude,&rdquo; &ldquo;yoroshiku onegai itashimasu correct,&rdquo; etc., but
I couldn&rsquo;t find a single one explaining that &ldquo;&lsquo;Yoroshiku onegai itashimasu&rsquo; is correct writing and not rude to the other party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So perhaps this article might be the first in Japan.
Even if not, it&rsquo;s surely contributing to spreading awareness, so I&rsquo;d be happy if in the future I hear people say &ldquo;I thought &lsquo;Yoroshiku onegai itashimasu&rsquo; was rude, but it&rsquo;s actually correct writing.&rdquo;</p>
