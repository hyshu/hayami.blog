<p>My mother&rsquo;s illness was discovered around the beginning of spring.<br>
Thanks to several fortunate coincidences, we were able to detect the illness early and have her treated at a good hospital.<br>
Because of this, it didn&rsquo;t become a serious matter.</p>
<p>However, surgery alone wasn&rsquo;t enough for a complete cure, and she received medication while attending the hospital for about six months.</p>
<h1 id="the-advancing-of-artificial-intelligence">The Advancing of Artificial Intelligence</h1>
<p>This year saw remarkable developments in artificial intelligence.<br>
Around the end of 2022, it was newsworthy just that a method for creating natural Japanese text had emerged.<br>
By March 2023, it became easily accessible to everyone, and now programmers use it as a matter of course.</p>
<p>Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which can program with realistic accuracy, appeared in the latter half of this year, and we&rsquo;re finally approaching an era where we may not need to write code by hand.</p>
<p>Personally, I welcome this since I don&rsquo;t enjoy programming, but it also means the gap with beginners is becoming smaller, so I may not survive unless I keep thinking about countermeasures.</p>
<h1 id="the-end-of-app-research">The End of App Research</h1>
<p>CatchApp, the only site in Japan where you could view App Store apps in order of newest releases, was essential for the annual app research I conducted, but the service ended around July this year.
<a href="https://catchapp.net">https://catchapp.net</a></p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t have done my research without this site. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>In 2023, I installed 10,921 apps, and from 2020 to 2023, I installed a total of 51,350 iOS apps.<br>
By the way, the 3,000+ apps I installed in 2019 are excluded because I unfortunately lost the backup.</p>
<p>Next year, I&rsquo;ll be working on reinstalling apps from 2020 onwards and categorizing useful apps.<br>
My ultimate goal is to create an iPhone with only reference apps and favorite apps installed.</p>
<h1 id="bonsai">Bonsai</h1>
<p>I only attended classes about twice this year, as I took time off due to my mother&rsquo;s medical treatment.<br>
The severe heat was harsh again this year, and many bonsai suffered damage, but I think they&rsquo;ll be fine from next year.</p>
<h1 id="ring-fit-adventure-a-five-month-battle">Ring Fit Adventure: A Five-Month Battle</h1>
<p>Last year, I stopped during my third playthrough (effectively my sixth) because the no-item stages were too difficult, but when I resumed at the beginning of this year, I cleared it easily on the first day.</p>

<div class="figure">

</div>
<div class="article-body">
<p>After that, things progressed smoothly, and around May I thought I might clear it easily, but<br>
my partner character Ring said something ominous.</p>

<p>Another no-item stage.</p>
<p>Smoothies are items you can drink while fighting enemies that increase attack power, heal you, or let you revive after being defeated - they&rsquo;re essential for gameplay.</p>
</div>
<div class="figure">
	<img src="/images/2024/ringfit-3.jpg">
</div>
<div class="article-body">
<p>At this point, the level difference from the appropriate level was 80. It was impossible to clear without smoothies.</p>

<p>This from just one attack.<br>
I need three attacks to defeat them, and I have to keep healing until the enemy takes a rest turn.<br>
So the time to win varies greatly from 5 to 30 minutes.</p>
<p>And after defeating them, the real challenge awaits.</p>
</div>
<div class="figure">
	<img src="/images/2024/ringfit-5.jpg">
</div>
<div class="article-body">
<p>If I take attacks from two of these, I lose.<br>
To win, I need to be lucky enough to act twice in a row on the first turn, then survive the next turn without taking damage.</p>
<p>The probability is extremely low, and since it takes time to defeat the first enemy, it requires patience.</p>
<p>I was also leveling up in other stages, but no matter how much I leveled up, it never got easier, so I gave up and decided to just keep fighting.</p>
<p>A few months later, my level had increased by 36, and while I still needed three attacks to defeat the first enemy, I could now defeat 3 out of 4 of the next enemies in 2 turns.</p>
<p>Finally cleared. It took 46 minutes, but this is the time for a single attempt.</p>
<p>And so, the battle that began on April 7th and ended on September 11th - a five-month struggle in total - came to a conclusion.</p>

<p>And with that, my sixth playthrough is complete.<br>
In 2025, I plan to finish the stages I haven&rsquo;t cleared yet.<br>
I wonder if a new game will come out.</p>
