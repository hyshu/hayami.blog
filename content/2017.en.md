I categorized ideas and clear my mind, throughout the year.

# Books
* Abundance: The Future Is Better Than You Think / Peter H. Diamandis & Steven Kotler
* Bold: How to Go Big, Create Wealth and Impact the World / Peter H. Diamandis & Steven Kotler
* The first six book of Rich Dad series / Robert T. Kiyosaki
* The Shift: The Future of Work Is Already Here / Lynda Gratton
* 人口から読む日本の歴史 / Hiroshi Kito
* Symphony No 9 / Yusuke Nakagawa

# Classics

* Gustav Mahler / Symphonie Nr. 1 D-dur
* Georges Bizet / Carmen
* Ottorino Respighi / Pini di Roma
* Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky / The Nutcracker
* Carl Orff / Carmina Burana
* Bedřich Smetana / "The Moldau" from Má Vlast

What left the deepest impression on me was "Pini di Roma". I will never forget the dignity of its climax, with the wind instruments playing over one another, an experience unobtainable just by listening to a CD.

# Bonsai

I began growing bonsai.

I haven't grown anything but kokedama (moss balls) at this point, but I hope to get serious about it starting next year.

# CEDEC 2017
This year, I participated in CEDEC for the first time.

There were many wonderful talks. In particular, Nintendo's session completely overturned what I thought of as conventional wisdom when it comes to large-scale development.

Tasks to be done or bugs to be solved are reported via screenshots with text, and then inspected. This seemingly common sense workflow was not employed in the development of Zelda BotW. You could use your mouse to click on scenes, places, and objects in the game to directly lodge a report.
