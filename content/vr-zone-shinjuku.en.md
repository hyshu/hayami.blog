VR ZONE SHINJUKU is a VR-focused entertainment facility located in Shinjuku.
(Note: It closed on March 31, 2019, upon completion of its operating period)

This was my second visit since last July, and this time I experienced the newly added Dragon Quest VR, so I'll introduce it along with content from my first visit.

Regarding photography inside the facility, it's allowed {{< link title="except inside activities and for commercial purposes" url="https://vrzone-pic.com/shinjuku/faq.html" >}}. Since this blog is a non-profit site without advertisements, and the activity photos I'm posting were only those taken by the staff.

Activity list. Mario Kart and Evangelion were still the most popular.

At the entrance, there's a wooden monument with a forest CG video projected.

Since Dragon Quest VR was introduced, Dragon Quest monsters now also appear.

# Dragon Quest VR

The photo above is from the photography zone.

This was the main attraction. Not only was photography of the attraction prohibited, but smartphones also had to be stored in lockers.

You wear a backpack-type PC on your back and fight using stick-shaped controllers. VIVE trackers are attached to your hands.

Maximum of 4 members. Two warriors, one mage, and one priest work together in battle.

As monsters attack one after another, you fight using weapons. Warriors have shields, so they skillfully draw enemy attention to protect the mage and priest who can attack from a distance.

The priest is the only healer and can revive fallen allies, so losing them makes things quite difficult.

In VR, monsters taller than yourself are incredibly scary when they're right in front of you, but whether due to careful distance and character design considerations, it wasn't bothersome here.

They were using something other than VIVE trackers for position detection.

There was also a special corner at the shop.

# Mario Kart Arcade Grand Prix VR

{{< figure src="/images/vr-zone-shinjuku/mario-00.jpg" title="" >}}

This was the most fun this time.

By attaching VIVE trackers to the back of your hands, hand movements can be recreated in the game.

While you're basically just holding the steering wheel, this comes into play when grabbing and using items.

I was impressed by how much more fun Mario Kart becomes just by being able to look around.

I didn't experience the VR motion sickness common with vehicle-based experiences.

During gameplay.

There are pedals at your feet for acceleration, braking, and reversing.

(The game screen on the display behind is blurred just to be safe)

# Evangelion VR The Soul Seat: Berserk

{{< figure src="/images/vr-zone-shinjuku/eva.jpg" title="" >}}

You ride in something like a cockpit, but it only has devices for vibration and wind effects, with controls limited to hand levers.

The initial sequence of the Evangelion emerging to the surface is realistic. It feels like the Star Wars attraction at Disneyland.

The battle is short, and the game system takes time to understand, so by the time you start getting used to it, the outcome is already decided.

# Extreme Courage Test Hanechari

{{< figure src="/images/vr-zone-shinjuku/hanechari.jpg" title="" >}}

You explore valleys and caves on a hang glider-like vehicle with pedals.

Pedaling makes you ascend, and tilting the handle downward makes you glide forward.

The controls are intuitive, so it quickly becomes enjoyable.

# Fishing VR GIJESTA

{{< figure src="/images/vr-zone-shinjuku/fishing.jpg" title="" >}}

You operate using a fishing rod-shaped controller and a net (VIVE's official racket).

The fishing rod has a hand-crank device that you can turn to reel in when you catch a fish.

The number shown in the photo is that day's high score, achieved by someone I went with.

The score is completely luck-based - you can't get a good record unless a big fish appears within the time limit.

# Horror Experience Room Escape Ward Î© (Omega)

{{< figure src="/images/vr-zone-shinjuku/horror-00.jpg" title="" >}}

2-4 people proceed through an abandoned hospital.

{{< figure src="/images/vr-zone-shinjuku/horror-01.jpg" title="" >}}

You're in a wheelchair setting, moving forward by pushing the lever at hand.

The VIVE controller serves as a flashlight - without holding it up, it's pitch dark and you can barely see anything.

While it's made quite easy-going without jump scares, VR pairs well with horror, making it somewhat scary.

Partway through, you split into those who get captured and those who explore the maze-like hospital.

The captured person can see how their teammates are progressing through the maze on a map, so they verbally guide the explorers toward the goal.

However, the explorers don't expect others to be captured, and with headphones on, communication is extremely difficult. We ended up just shouting at each other until game over.

# Rapid Descent Experience Machine Ski Rodeo

{{< figure src="/images/vr-zone-shinjuku/ski.jpg" title="" >}}

You stand on a vehicle with a board-like device at your feet that tilts left and right, controlling your direction by which way you lean.

While quite different from actual skiing, the controls were easy to understand.

There's a wind device in front that enhances the sense of speed.
