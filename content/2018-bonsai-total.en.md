This is a compilation of works I created during this year at the bonsai and bonkei classes I've been attending since last December.

Initially, I was such a plant novice that I could only recognize cherry blossoms when looking at plants, but I've come to identify several species now.

Also, I've come to understand a glimpse of the "beauty" of bonsai and bonkei... I think. Probably about 1 millimeter's worth.

# The Difference Between Bonsai and Bonkei
Bonsai involves planting a single species of plant. Any additions are limited to moss or small companion plants at most. What's important is how that single species is planted and cultivated.

Bonkei involves planting several types of plants. The characteristic is expressing through the combination of species, spacing, and arrangement.

# January
{{< figure src="/images/2018-bonsai-total/01-00.jpg" title="" >}}

* Iwa-uchiwa (Shortia uniflora)
* Shojobakama (Heloniopsis orientalis)
* Ryu-no-hige (Ophiopogon japonicus - Mondo grass)

Three species that grow in shade (Ryu-no-hige can also grow in sun).

This was my first bonkei that wasn't a moss ball, and since it didn't go very well, the teacher mostly did it for me.

Perhaps because my balcony was sunny, or maybe I overwatered them, everything except the Ryu-no-hige died rather quickly. The path is steep...

# March
{{< figure src="/images/2018-bonsai-total/03-00.jpg" title="" >}}

* Mini Iris (JS Dito)
* Species Tulip (Little Beauty) Pink
* Primrose (Double-flowered)

{{< figure src="/images/2018-bonsai-total/03-01.jpg" title="" >}}

Apparently, species tulips that haven't been bred for improvement have become popular again recently.

# April
{{< figure src="/images/2018-bonsai-total/04-00.jpg" title="" >}}

* Dwarf Rhododendron
* Dokudami (Houttuynia cordata)

I missed April due to other commitments, but the teacher made this for me.

The photo was taken after the blooming period, but it produced beautiful purple bell-like flowers.

Since it was in a shallow pot with mounded soil for good drainage, when I watered it the same as the others, the dwarf rhododendron couldn't withstand this year's intense heat and died...

Later, the teacher replaced the dwarf rhododendron with baby's breath. I'm relieved that this one has successfully made it through the year.

# May
{{< figure src="/images/2018-bonsai-total/05-00.jpg" title="" >}}

* Tsukushino Wild Rose
* Ibuki Thyme
* Nikko Otome Hosta

I couldn't attend in May either, so the teacher made this for me.

I was surprised by how impressive the composition was.

# June
{{< figure src="/images/2018-bonsai-total/06-00.jpg" title="" >}}

* Sand Moss (Racomitrium canescens)
* Mountain Moss

This was the session for planting moss. While it looks simple, planting bit by bit with tweezers was quite difficult.

{{< figure src="/images/2018-bonsai-total/06-01.jpg" title="" >}}

Mountain moss seems easy but actually has quite a lot of variation, making it extremely challenging to arrange evenly.

Also, sand moss falls apart easily if you don't grab it correctly.

As a bonus, I received a variegated Sedum (Chuban Misebaya).

Both sand moss and Misebaya grow well with good sunlight. If they're in a place that gets rain, they barely need water.

# July
{{< figure src="/images/2018-bonsai-total/07-00.jpg" title="" >}}

* Variegated Spindle Tree
* Yakushima Keibiran (Cymbidium)

I was told that Keibiran is difficult to grow because the leaves fall easily, so I was relieved to successfully raise it.

I was shocked when forgetting to water for just one day on a hot day caused an entire branch's worth of leaves to wither instantly. They fall off with just a slight lift, so it's quite challenging.

About 30% of the leaves remained even at the end of autumn, allowing me to enjoy the autumn colors for a long time.

# August
{{< figure src="/images/2018-bonsai-total/08-00.jpg" title="" >}}

* White Egret Orchid (Habenaria radiata)

This session was mainly lecture-based. Not just about egret orchids, but about growing and ecology of bulbous plants in general.

{{< figure src="/images/2018-bonsai-total/08-01.jpg" title="" >}}

Apparently, this is a variety called "Hisho" (Flight).

# September
{{< figure src="/images/2018-bonsai-total/09-00.jpg" title="" >}}

* Japanese Beautyberry (Callicarpa japonica)
* Kamazuka (Asian serviceberry)
* Sakhalin Stonecrop
* Dewgrass

Though not visible in the photo, the tall Japanese beautyberry with its purple berries is beautiful.
I was amazed by the strength of bamboo roots. Apparently, no matter what else withers, bamboo stays vigorous.

# October
{{< figure src="/images/2018-bonsai-total/10-00.jpg" title="" >}}

* Red-flowered Variegated Daimonji
* Variegated Eupatorium
* Cardinal Flower (Lobelia cardinalis)

I've forgotten which was mine, but I think it was the left one.

Autumn is chrysanthemum season. The Eupatorium has flowers that look like tuna, which is interesting.

From this month, having the teacher do things for me was reduced to just final touch-ups. I'm happy about that.

Still, I'm just at the very beginning of the path of bonsai and bonkei.

# November
{{< figure src="/images/2018-bonsai-total/11-00.jpg" title="" >}}

* Mountain Chive (Allium thunbergii)
* Ashizuri Chrysanthemum
* Blue Sky Chrysanthemum

I was surprised to plant chives as bonkei since I thought they were just for eating. They had a very strong chive smell.

Since they're quite tall, they look nice displayed in a room when receiving guests.

# December
{{< figure src="/images/2018-bonsai-total/12-00.jpg" title="" >}}

* Pine
* Plum
* Bamboo

Bonus:

* Ardisia japonica
* Mountain Moss

I couldn't attend the last class of the year... The teacher made it for me.

Since it's pine-bamboo-plum (a traditional lucky combination), I had my parents display it when I visited home for New Year's. The plum blossoms began blooming around January 5th and peaked on the 12th.

The moss balls were made last year.
