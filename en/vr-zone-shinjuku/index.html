<p>VR ZONE SHINJUKU is a VR-focused entertainment facility located in Shinjuku.
(Note: It closed on March 31, 2019, upon completion of its operating period)</p>
<p>This was my second visit since last July, and this time I experienced the newly added Dragon Quest VR, so I&rsquo;ll introduce it along with content from my first visit.</p>
<p>Regarding photography inside the facility, it&rsquo;s allowed <a href="https://vrzone-pic.com/shinjuku/faq.html" target="_blank">except inside activities and for commercial purposes</a>. Since this blog is a non-profit site without advertisements, and the activity photos I&rsquo;m posting were only those taken by the staff.</p>

<p>Activity list. Mario Kart and Evangelion were still the most popular.</p>
</div>

<p>At the entrance, there&rsquo;s a wooden monument with a forest CG video projected.</p>
<p>Since Dragon Quest VR was introduced, Dragon Quest monsters now also appear.</p>

<p>The photo above is from the photography zone.</p>
<p>This was the main attraction. Not only was photography of the attraction prohibited, but smartphones also had to be stored in lockers.</p>

<p>You wear a backpack-type PC on your back and fight using stick-shaped controllers. VIVE trackers are attached to your hands.</p>
<p>Maximum of 4 members. Two warriors, one mage, and one priest work together in battle.</p>
<p>As monsters attack one after another, you fight using weapons. Warriors have shields, so they skillfully draw enemy attention to protect the mage and priest who can attack from a distance.</p>
<p>The priest is the only healer and can revive fallen allies, so losing them makes things quite difficult.</p>
<p>In VR, monsters taller than yourself are incredibly scary when they&rsquo;re right in front of you, but whether due to careful distance and character design considerations, it wasn&rsquo;t bothersome here.</p>
<p>They were using something other than VIVE trackers for position detection.</p>

<p>There was also a special corner at the shop.</p>

<p>This was the most fun this time.</p>

<div class="article-body">
<p>By attaching VIVE trackers to the back of your hands, hand movements can be recreated in the game.</p>
<p>While you&rsquo;re basically just holding the steering wheel, this comes into play when grabbing and using items.</p>
<p>I was impressed by how much more fun Mario Kart becomes just by being able to look around.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t experience the VR motion sickness common with vehicle-based experiences.</p>

<p>During gameplay.</p>
<p>There are pedals at your feet for acceleration, braking, and reversing.</p>
<p>(The game screen on the display behind is blurred just to be safe)</p>
<h1 id="evangelion-vr-the-soul-seat-berserk">Evangelion VR The Soul Seat: Berserk</h1>
</div>
<div class="figure">
	<img src="/images/vr-zone-shinjuku/eva.jpg">
</div>
<div class="article-body">
<p>You ride in something like a cockpit, but it only has devices for vibration and wind effects, with controls limited to hand levers.</p>
<p>The initial sequence of the Evangelion emerging to the surface is realistic. It feels like the Star Wars attraction at Disneyland.</p>
<p>The battle is short, and the game system takes time to understand, so by the time you start getting used to it, the outcome is already decided.</p>

<div class="article-body">
<p>You explore valleys and caves on a hang glider-like vehicle with pedals.</p>
<p>Pedaling makes you ascend, and tilting the handle downward makes you glide forward.</p>
<p>The controls are intuitive, so it quickly becomes enjoyable.</p>
<h1 id="fishing-vr-gijesta">Fishing VR GIJESTA</h1>
</div>
<div class="figure">
	<img src="/images/vr-zone-shinjuku/fishing.jpg">
</div>
<div class="article-body">
<p>You operate using a fishing rod-shaped controller and a net (VIVE&rsquo;s official racket).</p>
<p>The fishing rod has a hand-crank device that you can turn to reel in when you catch a fish.</p>
<p>The number shown in the photo is that day&rsquo;s high score, achieved by someone I went with.</p>
<p>The score is completely luck-based - you can&rsquo;t get a good record unless a big fish appears within the time limit.</p>

<p>2-4 people proceed through an abandoned hospital.</p>
</div>
<div class="figure">
	<img src="/images/vr-zone-shinjuku/horror-01.jpg">
</div>
<div class="article-body">
<p>You&rsquo;re in a wheelchair setting, moving forward by pushing the lever at hand.</p>
<p>The VIVE controller serves as a flashlight - without holding it up, it&rsquo;s pitch dark and you can barely see anything.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s made quite easy-going without jump scares, VR pairs well with horror, making it somewhat scary.</p>
<p>Partway through, you split into those who get captured and those who explore the maze-like hospital.</p>
<p>The captured person can see how their teammates are progressing through the maze on a map, so they verbally guide the explorers toward the goal.</p>
<p>However, the explorers don&rsquo;t expect others to be captured, and with headphones on, communication is extremely difficult. We ended up just shouting at each other until game over.</p>

<div class="figure">

</div>
<div class="article-body">
<p>You stand on a vehicle with a board-like device at your feet that tilts left and right, controlling your direction by which way you lean.</p>
<p>While quite different from actual skiing, the controls were easy to understand.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a wind device in front that enhances the sense of speed.</p>
