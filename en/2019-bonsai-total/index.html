      <p>Here&rsquo;s a compilation of works created during my monthly bonsai and bonsai landscape classes throughout this year.</p>
<p>While last year focused mainly on bonsai landscapes, this year I moved on to a course on small bonsai (bonsai up to 15cm in height).</p>
<p>Next year, I&rsquo;d like to try creating some on my own.</p>
<p>This year, several of my pots suffered devastating damage from the wind coming out of the air conditioner&rsquo;s outdoor unit.</p>
<p>Since I water them in the cool morning hours, I was slow to notice the problem. However, the outdoor unit in the afternoon produces what could be called gale-force winds, and even though I thought I had placed them at a sufficient distance, apparently the leaves and branches were still being stressed. It&rsquo;s frightening to think the same thing might have happened last year.</p>
<p>Next year, I truly want to have a bonsai life where nothing dies.</p>

<div class="article-body">
<ul>
<li>Rock Pine (Iwamatsu)</li>
<li>Miyama Azalea (Miyama Kirishima)</li>
</ul>
<p>Rock Pine is a fern plant, so when combined with rocks it sticks to them and looks extremely cool.</p>
<p>Normally it stays dried and curled up as shown in the photo, but when you water it, the leaves open up the next day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s drought-resistant so you don&rsquo;t need to be too careful about watering, but sunlight is crucial and depending on placement, it might not survive the winter.</p>

<ul>
<li>Fuji Cherry</li>
</ul>
<p>Sadly, it apparently couldn&rsquo;t survive the intense midsummer heat.</p>
<p>I say &ldquo;apparently&rdquo; because, having switched from the alpine plants course to the bonsai course this year, I couldn&rsquo;t tell whether it had died or if the leaves had just fallen due to the season ending.</p>
<p>I kept thinking it was just because the season had ended, but after being taught how to identify dead trees and checking it later, it was definitely dead. Someday I&rsquo;d like to try cherry trees again.</p>

<div class="article-body">
<ul>
<li>Maxillaria</li>
</ul>
<p>A type of orchid. Planted in sphagnum moss, with nails hammered into driftwood and wrapped with wire or fishing line.</p>
<p>I was busy during this period and overslept, so my teacher made it for me. When I woke up, my alarm clock had been stuffed into my bonsai tool box.</p>
<h1 id="april">April</h1>
<ul>
<li>Japanese Maple</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ll post photos later when the leaves come out and it&rsquo;s nicely arranged.</p>
<h1 id="may">May</h1>

<div class="article-body">
<ul>
<li>Chinese Elm (Nire Keyaki)</li>
</ul>
<p>In summer, the branches grow vigorously, making pruning enjoyable.</p>
<p>In winter, all those leaves fall off spectacularly.</p>
<h1 id="june">June</h1>

<div class="article-body">
<ul>
<li>Opal</li>
<li>Black Rose (Kurohoushi)</li>
<li>Sempervivum</li>
</ul>
<p>I forgot what the small bonus plant was.</p>
<p>I had wanted to try succulents, so I requested them and they were included as a subject for the class.</p>
<p>The combination was difficult since they&rsquo;re all completely different in size and shape.</p>

<div class="article-body">
<ul>
<li>Pine</li>
</ul>
<p>A session on pine maintenance.</p>
<p>Through the process of turning a wildly overgrown pine prepared by the teacher into a proper bonsai, I learned what a terrible mess pines become without maintenance.</p>
<h1 id="august">August</h1>

<div class="figure">

<div class="article-body">
<ul>
<li>Red Rosewood (Benishitan)</li>
<li>Tiger-striped Liriope (Torafu Yaburan)</li>
</ul>
<p>I was absent, so my teacher made this for me.</p>
<h1 id="september">September</h1>

<div class="article-body">
<ul>
<li>Chirimen Vine (Chirimen Kazura)</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking something with densely packed branches and leaves that looks bushy, reducing the leaves and spreading the branches with wire to make it into a beautiful bonsai.</p>
<p>Apparently my watering method was fundamentally wrong, and this one died quickly&hellip; Being a complete beginner with plants, this became an opportunity to think about watering.</p>
<h1 id="october">October</h1>

<div class="figure">

<div class="article-body">
<ul>
<li>Ashizuri Chrysanthemum (Ashizurinogiku)</li>
<li>Small Beach Chrysanthemum (Kohamagiku)</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning the depth of chrysanthemums. Autumn means chrysanthemums.</p>
<p>Since they bloom spreading from a single stem, it&rsquo;s difficult to arrange them with other chrysanthemums or plants.</p>
<h1 id="december">December</h1>

<div class="figure">

<div class="article-body">
<ul>
<li>White Rosewood (Shiroshitan)</li>
<li>Purple Beautyberry (Murasakishikibu)</li>
<li>October Stonecrop (Misebaya)</li>
</ul>
<p>Just like last year, I was absent for the final class again.</p>
<p>My teacher made it for me. I received Misebaya as a bonus before too, and I like it.</p>
