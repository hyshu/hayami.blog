COVID-19.

Since I had just started my company this year, I spent almost the entire year working from home, so I wasn't affected much. But if this had happened a few years earlier or later, it could have been a disaster.

We still can't see what lies ahead, so I want to stay vigilant.

# App Research
I wrote last year about how I was constantly installing domestic iOS apps, and I was able to successfully publish an article on note.

(Note: When I migrated to Zenn in 2022, I deleted this as the information had become outdated)

That said, the work of continuously launching 3,000 apps was incredibly tedious, and it ended up taking until April.

This year, since I created an app for management purposes, I should be able to install over 10,000 apps. However, since I only started creating the app and the installation work around September, I have a feeling it's going to take about as long as last year.

Installing apps itself is extremely valuable as it allows me to see trends not only in the app industry but across the entire IT industry.

I'd also like to stabilize the process.

I started studying deep learning this year, so I read several reference books.

# Company
zoome is currently developing a VR escape game, but it's proving difficult.

Since we couldn't see a clear path forward with this alone, I thought about whether we could create something using the deep learning I had been studying in parallel, which led to releasing the honorific translation app as mentioned in {{< link title="the previous article" url="../honorific-converter/" >}}.

In zoome's {{< link title="founding article" url="../zoome/" >}}, I had written at length about the VR escape game that was supposed to be the company's first product, but since the honorific translation was completed first, I deleted those sections. It's definitely not because I was embarrassed.

When we first founded the company, we only had plans for AR/VR business, but going forward, we plan to pursue business that includes deep learning as well.

We've also come up with several ideas for the AR/VR business, so I want to continue creating things bit by bit, including the VR escape game, to accumulate know-how.
