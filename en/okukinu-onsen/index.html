<p>Meotobuchi is located about an hour and a half by bus deeper into the mountains from Kinugawa Onsen.</p>
<p>This time, I went to a ryokan called Kaniyu, which is another 30 minutes away by shuttle bus from there.</p>
<p>First, getting to Kinugawa Onsen.</p>
<p>During the train journey, you can see lots of rice fields and mountains.</p>

<p>Speaking of Kinugawa, it&rsquo;s famous for the Nikko Monkey Troupe, and they were performing.</p>

<p>Apparently, they were celebrating the first anniversary of the SL train operation, and there was quite a crowd.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not particularly a fan of steam locomotives, but thinking that some people probably came specifically to see this ceremony, I felt it would be a waste not to watch, so I did.</p>

<p>The Kinutateiwa Suspension Bridge. It swayed a bit since it&rsquo;s a suspension bridge, which was scary.</p>

<p>After crossing the bridge, the path splits into a route that climbs the mountain and one that goes through a tunnel.</p>
<p>Under the tunnel was quite beautiful, especially since it had just rained.</p>

<p>Ichiryu-kaku ryokan that we passed along the way.</p>
<p>I heard this place is also popular, and apparently the hot spring water is clear.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a rest area near the entrance with an amazing atmosphere, featuring stuffed bears and deer, and armor. They must be real.</p>

<p>The river photographed from the room window. The water level is quite low, probably due to the consecutive days of extreme heat.</p>
<p>Kaniyu is characterized by its white, cloudy hot spring water, and the outdoor bath was particularly open and refreshing.</p>
<p>There are seven types of baths, including some with clear water.</p>
<p>Being deep in the mountains at this time of year, there were tons of insects. I&rsquo;d like to go again in autumn or winter.</p>

<p>The cuisine made generous use of mountain delicacies and was very delicious. This is something unique to ryokans deep in the mountains.</p>

<p>On the return bus, we could see valleys and dams, which made for nice scenery.</p>
