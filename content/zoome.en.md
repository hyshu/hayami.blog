Today, I founded zoome LLC.

{{< link title="https://zoome.co.jp/" url="https://zoome.co.jp/" >}}

The company is planned to develop and operate services centered around AR/VR.

# Origin of the Company Name
The English word "zoom" is a verb meaning rapid increase or change, used to describe things like aircraft climbing sharply, vehicles suddenly accelerating, or stock prices soaring.
Additionally, depending on context, it can be used as a noun meaning "rapid development and growth."

By adding the suffix "er" to this, it becomes "zoomer," which could mean "a person or thing that develops and grows rapidly", but at least in Japan, it has a strong impression as a motorcycle product name.  
Also, it's difficult to register a trademark with just a single English word.

Therefore, I created the word "zoome" which (I arbitrarily decided) holds the meaning of both zoom and zoomer, and made it the company name (pronounced the same as zoom).

Growth tends to be noticed only when visible differences appear, but I believe that steady daily accumulation is actually more important, and growth cannot occur without it.

The corporate philosophy is to continue striving toward moments when companies and people "zoome" in a positive direction.

# Logo
Since the + symbol is often used in icons for "zoom in," which refers to the ability to magnify something, I combined it with the letter z and created it based on a diagonal line at 45 degrees representing growth.

For the typography, I placed an italicized m from {{< link title="Jost" url="https://indestructibletype.com/Jost.html" >}} and created the rest to match it.

To make the pronunciation of the company name clearer, I increased the slant of the e to make it slightly harder to read, allowing the "zoom" portion to be recognized first.

Since AR/VR is new technology, I chose red, a color that easily conveys an energetic impression.

# Reason for Being an LLC
xR (a general term for VR, AR, MR, etc.) is a rapidly growing technology, so unless it can be successfully linked with existing businesses, corporate value at present is difficult to predict.

If fundraising is to be conducted, it would be better to do so after accumulating sufficient technical assets (source code, know-how, 3D model data, etc.), or to separate and spin off into individual business domains.

Considering the above, I thought that an LLC (Limited Liability Company), which has no obligation for financial disclosure and allows for flexible rules through its articles of incorporation, would not only save time but also make it easier to create a flexible structure.
