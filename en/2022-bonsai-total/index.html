      <p>Here&rsquo;s a compilation of all the works created during my monthly bonsai and penjing classes throughout this year.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been so busy lately that I often miss taking photos when the plants are at their peak.<br>
The photos are even more casual than usual this year, so I hope you&rsquo;ll be forgiving.<br>
Also, I forgot to write dates in my notes, so there might be some mix-ups.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s rainy season was abnormal - it started earlier than usual and was immediately followed by a few days of sudden intense heat right after it ended.<br>
During this brief period, 2-3 bonsai suffered serious damage, but other than that, I think I managed to grow them well.</p>
<h1 id="january">January</h1>
<p>I had to skip class due to sudden temperature changes that affected my health.</p>
<h1 id="february">February</h1>

<ul>
<li>Fuji Cherry</li>
</ul>
<p>When I consulted with my teacher about cherry trees not growing well every year, I received this one that had a thick branch cut in a dogleg shape due to disease.<br>
From the opposite side, you don&rsquo;t notice it at all, and the way the branches grow as if flowing to the left is nice.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pussy Willow from Shimanto River</li>
<li>Yatsufusa Cherry (a variety of Fuji Cherry)</li>
</ul>
<p>The pussy willow flowers are still flowers even like this. It shows the fascinating nature of plants.</p>

<ul>
<li>Japanese Larch</li>
<li>Sakhalin Fir</li>
</ul>
<p>Although they&rsquo;re pines, they&rsquo;re not evergreen, so they shed their needles in winter.</p>

<ul>
<li>Miyama Kirishima (Kyushu Azalea)</li>
</ul>
<p>From here, it will become more beautiful by spreading the branches radially over many years.</p>
<p>The rock is apparently Mt. Fuji lava, and has a very nice color.</p>

<div class="article-body">
<ul>
<li>Japanese Maple</li>
<li>Conandron (Rock Tobacco)</li>
<li>Hosta</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the maple likes sunlight, I placed it where it could get even a little sun during the rainy season, but due to the sudden end of the rainy season mentioned earlier, the Conandron suffered in just two days&hellip;
The others survived the winter well. However, I couldn&rsquo;t see the autumn colors.</p>

<div class="article-body">
<ul>
<li>White Forsythia</li>
</ul>
<p>Beautiful white flowers bloomed just as the name suggests.<br>
Since branches grow in various directions, I&rsquo;m wondering what shape to create.</p>
<ul>
<li>Camellia</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="june">June</h1>
<p>I had to skip due to being extremely busy with the annual app survey reaching its peak.</p>
<h1 id="july">July</h1>
<ul>
<li>Japanese Zelkova</li>
<li>Japanese Maple</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, my favorite maple couldn&rsquo;t survive the winter, so I received a new one.</p>
<h1 id="august">August</h1>

<div class="figure">

<div class="article-body">
<ul>
<li>Chinese Juniper</li>
<li>Daphne</li>
<li>Velvet Sekisho (Japanese Sweet Flag)</li>
</ul>
<p>I learned that it&rsquo;s important to consider which direction to extend them.<br>
The Daphne will be extended to the left, the Chinese Juniper downward.</p>
<h1 id="september">September</h1>
<p>I forgot to keep records.<br>
Only a note remains that it was a smaller bonsai.</p>
<h1 id="october">October</h1>
<ul>
<li>Narrow-leaf Maple</li>
<li>Trident Maple</li>
</ul>
<p>I learned how to maintain the petrified Tokiwa Fern (cat&rsquo;s paw) that I had made in a previous class.</p>
<p>Ferns have interesting leaf shapes, and since they prefer shade, they lose vigor if you fuss over them too much or water them excessively, which is also interesting.<br>
I heard there are people who only do fern bonsai.</p>
<p>When you look at mountains, the way ferns grow is distinctive and interesting.</p>
<h1 id="november">November</h1>
<p>The Chinese Juniper I received previously had grown quite bushy, so my teacher improved its appearance.</p>

<p>Amazing&hellip; this is bonsai&hellip;</p>
<p>Apparently, it&rsquo;s important to decide what to showcase. In this case, it&rsquo;s the undulating trunk. My teacher created this shape over many years when the branches were still thin and bendable.<br>
Personally, I like the whitish parts of the trunk (apparently not shari/deadwood).</p>
<p>After pruning, the color of the foliage will deteriorate quite a bit as it gets colder, but it will become healthy again between April and May.</p>
<h1 id="december">December</h1>
<ul>
<li>Adonis (Pheasant&rsquo;s Eye)</li>
</ul>
<p>The roots are apparently highly poisonous. They were purple in color and so fragile that they would easily break with just a light touch.<br>
While we often think of plants as having lush green leaves in summer, the Adonis completely disappears by summer.</p>
<p>Beautiful flowers bloomed in February 2023.</p>
