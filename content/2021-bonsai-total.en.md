Here's a compilation of the works I created during my monthly bonsai and penjing classes throughout this year.

This year, perhaps because I had more space on my balcony, I struggled with leaf burn.
While leaf burn rarely kills the plant, unless you're very lucky, it prevents fruits and flowers from blooming that year.

As in previous years, surviving the peak summer heat remains a challenge.
I've come to understand that May is also crucial for heat-sensitive varieties.
Year by year, the number of bonsai that can survive the midsummer is increasing, so I hope to have an even better bonsai life next year.

* Plum
* Princess Rose (Gokuhime Rose)

The secret to making plum blossoms bloom abundantly is apparently to torture them relentlessly without watering.

In summer, no matter how wilted the leaves become, they stand up again the next day after watering.

The Princess Rose is supposedly the smallest rose variety, and while it's as cute as it looks, sadly it seemed difficult for it to endure the summer.

I tried transferring it to a teacup without drainage holes and filling it with water, but even then it was completely dry by the end of the day.
Of course, I also avoided direct sunlight.

When the intense heat continued, it couldn't endure anymore and withered.

Since it didn't all fit in the pot (or rather, teacup), I tried putting just one flower in a glass vase, which looked stylishly nice.

However, perhaps due to lack of air circulation, it only lasted about a month, so next time I'd like to try this with different flowers and some improvements.

* Red-flowered Nanzan Violet 'Koju'
* Mt. Fuji Cherry 'Dance on the Lake'

(No cherry blossom photos available)

Both the violet and cherry weakened during the hot days in May and couldn't survive the peak summer heat, so I'll be careful about this next year.

When I consulted my teacher about the cherry not producing many leaves, I learned that coolness is important even in places without direct sunlight.

I'll pay attention not only to sunlight and water but also to ventilation.

* Cherry Rose
* Wild Rose
* Double-flowered Wild Rose

The Cherry Rose is apparently a recent new variety that blooms with beautiful cherry-colored flowers as its name suggests.

It was interesting how the color of the petals varied completely depending on how good the sunlight was just before blooming.

This year the sun was too strong, all the roses got leaf burn, and both wild roses didn't make it.
I forgot which wild rose it was, but I received a new one. I'll know when it blooms next year.

The Cherry Rose recovered and successfully bloomed with beautiful flowers.

* Yellow-spotted Rock Hosta
* Original Tulip Species
* Mountain Hydrangea 'Golden Atsuhime'

A combination of all yellow varieties.

The flowering and fruiting times vary, with the Rock Hosta producing purple berries.

The Mountain Hydrangea is apparently a new variety that cannot be propagated and sold without permission.

The tulip had been without water for several days beforehand, then I watered it thoroughly and left it for about 30 minutes to take the photo. Instead of opening in the normal closed way, it opened up as shown in the photo.

# May

* Privet (Ibota)

Apparently becoming popular recently.
A variety that looks very beautiful but suffers from its unfortunate name.

# June

* Variegated Japanese Beautyberry

A variety I haven't had since September 2018.

It prefers moist conditions, so water thoroughly in summer.

You can enjoy it twice with both berries and flowers.

* Rose of Sharon (Mukuge)

Large, beautiful flowers bloom.
Though similar to roses, the flowers fall after just one day.

The branch structure is also good, so it's enjoyable even when not flowering.

# August

* Enkianthus (Dodan)

Can be enjoyed twice with autumn foliage and spring flowers.

However, due to leaf burn, the leaves fell before turning colors.

The leaves grew back afterward, but apparently didn't have the energy left to turn colors, so that enjoyment is postponed until next year.

I hope the flowers will bloom.

* Ruby Hawthorn

A variety that produces very large berries.

Apparently one of the largest among red berry varieties.

I tried eating one - it tasted like an olive without the oiliness and made sour.
According to my teacher, they're often made into jam.

# October

* Rock Pine

I was absent this day, so I received what my teacher made for me later.

My second Rock Pine since January 2019.

Last time I failed to grow it due to insufficient sunlight, but I later received a new one which is growing without problems.

So this is my second Rock Pine at home, but the colors are completely different which is fun.

The cultivation method differs from most other bonsai - apparently it's important to water as little as possible and provide lots of sunlight.

# November

* Cotoneaster
* Taniwatari

The Cotoneaster turns red in autumn as shown in the photo, creating a beautiful mix of green and red.
Apparently it produces red berries.

The Taniwatari hasn't bloomed yet, so I plan to post photos later. I hope it blooms...

(Added March 21, 2023)
Unfortunately, it withered without blooming.

(Added July 11, 2023)
Unable to give up, I continued watering it, and apparently the largest of the seven planted was still alive - beautiful flowers bloomed.

* Coral Ardisia (Ten-ryo variety)
* Plum
* Pine
* Chrysanthemum
* Dwarf Bamboo Grass

Since it was year-end, I made something for New Year's.

The largest scale ever.

To synchronize the plum's blooming time with the others, apparently you should keep it indoors at about 15Â°C for a while after the buds appear.

However, sadly, when I covered the Coral Ardisia with a plastic bag as bird protection and went back to my parents' house, the birds apparently removed it - the plastic bag was gone and the berries had been eaten.
Birds are quite clever, aren't they?

So I didn't try to synchronize the blooming times.

This photo is from March 2022.
Despite being such a large group planting, everything is healthy and has become an annual spring joy.
