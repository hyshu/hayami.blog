      <p>Here&rsquo;s a compilation of the works I created during my monthly bonsai and penjing classes throughout this year.</p>
<p>This year, perhaps because I had more space on my balcony, I struggled with leaf burn.
While leaf burn rarely kills the plant, unless you&rsquo;re very lucky, it prevents fruits and flowers from blooming that year.</p>
<p>As in previous years, surviving the peak summer heat remains a challenge.
I&rsquo;ve come to understand that May is also crucial for heat-sensitive varieties.
Year by year, the number of bonsai that can survive the midsummer is increasing, so I hope to have an even better bonsai life next year.</p>

<ul>
<li>Plum</li>
<li>Princess Rose (Gokuhime Rose)</li>
</ul>
<p>The secret to making plum blossoms bloom abundantly is apparently to torture them relentlessly without watering.</p>
<p>In summer, no matter how wilted the leaves become, they stand up again the next day after watering.</p>
<p>The Princess Rose is supposedly the smallest rose variety, and while it&rsquo;s as cute as it looks, sadly it seemed difficult for it to endure the summer.</p>
<p>I tried transferring it to a teacup without drainage holes and filling it with water, but even then it was completely dry by the end of the day.
Of course, I also avoided direct sunlight.</p>
<p>When the intense heat continued, it couldn&rsquo;t endure anymore and withered.</p>
<p>Since it didn&rsquo;t all fit in the pot (or rather, teacup), I tried putting just one flower in a glass vase, which looked stylishly nice.</p>
<p>However, perhaps due to lack of air circulation, it only lasted about a month, so next time I&rsquo;d like to try this with different flowers and some improvements.</p>

<li>Red-flowered Nanzan Violet &lsquo;Koju&rsquo;</li>
<li>Mt. Fuji Cherry &lsquo;Dance on the Lake&rsquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>(No cherry blossom photos available)</p>
<p>Both the violet and cherry weakened during the hot days in May and couldn&rsquo;t survive the peak summer heat, so I&rsquo;ll be careful about this next year.</p>
<p>When I consulted my teacher about the cherry not producing many leaves, I learned that coolness is important even in places without direct sunlight.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll pay attention not only to sunlight and water but also to ventilation.</p>

<ul>
<li>Cherry Rose</li>
<li>Wild Rose</li>
<li>Double-flowered Wild Rose</li>
</ul>
<p>The Cherry Rose is apparently a recent new variety that blooms with beautiful cherry-colored flowers as its name suggests.</p>
<p>It was interesting how the color of the petals varied completely depending on how good the sunlight was just before blooming.</p>
<p>This year the sun was too strong, all the roses got leaf burn, and both wild roses didn&rsquo;t make it.
I forgot which wild rose it was, but I received a new one. I&rsquo;ll know when it blooms next year.</p>
<p>The Cherry Rose recovered and successfully bloomed with beautiful flowers.</p>

<ul>
<li>Yellow-spotted Rock Hosta</li>
<li>Original Tulip Species</li>
<li>Mountain Hydrangea &lsquo;Golden Atsuhime&rsquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>A combination of all yellow varieties.</p>
<p>The flowering and fruiting times vary, with the Rock Hosta producing purple berries.</p>
<p>The Mountain Hydrangea is apparently a new variety that cannot be propagated and sold without permission.</p>
<p>The tulip had been without water for several days beforehand, then I watered it thoroughly and left it for about 30 minutes to take the photo. Instead of opening in the normal closed way, it opened up as shown in the photo.</p>

A variety that looks very beautiful but suffers from its unfortunate name.</p>

<p>A variety I haven&rsquo;t had since September 2018.</p>
<p>It prefers moist conditions, so water thoroughly in summer.</p>
<p>You can enjoy it twice with both berries and flowers.</p>

<ul>
<li>Rose of Sharon (Mukuge)</li>
</ul>
<p>Large, beautiful flowers bloom.
Though similar to roses, the flowers fall after just one day.</p>
<p>The branch structure is also good, so it&rsquo;s enjoyable even when not flowering.</p>

<ul>
<li>Enkianthus (Dodan)</li>
</ul>
<p>Can be enjoyed twice with autumn foliage and spring flowers.</p>
<p>However, due to leaf burn, the leaves fell before turning colors.</p>
<p>The leaves grew back afterward, but apparently didn&rsquo;t have the energy left to turn colors, so that enjoyment is postponed until next year.</p>
<p>I hope the flowers will bloom.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ruby Hawthorn</li>
</ul>
<p>A variety that produces very large berries.</p>
<p>Apparently one of the largest among red berry varieties.</p>
<p>I tried eating one - it tasted like an olive without the oiliness and made sour.
According to my teacher, they&rsquo;re often made into jam.</p>

</ul>
<p>I was absent this day, so I received what my teacher made for me later.</p>
<p>My second Rock Pine since January 2019.</p>
<p>Last time I failed to grow it due to insufficient sunlight, but I later received a new one which is growing without problems.</p>
<p>So this is my second Rock Pine at home, but the colors are completely different which is fun.</p>
<p>The cultivation method differs from most other bonsai - apparently it&rsquo;s important to water as little as possible and provide lots of sunlight.</p>

<ul>
<li>Cotoneaster</li>
<li>Taniwatari</li>
</ul>
<p>The Cotoneaster turns red in autumn as shown in the photo, creating a beautiful mix of green and red.
Apparently it produces red berries.</p>
<p>The Taniwatari hasn&rsquo;t bloomed yet, so I plan to post photos later. I hope it blooms&hellip;</p>
<p>(Added March 21, 2023)
Unfortunately, it withered without blooming.</p>
<p>(Added July 11, 2023)
Unable to give up, I continued watering it, and apparently the largest of the seven planted was still alive - beautiful flowers bloomed.</p>

<li>Coral Ardisia (Ten-ryo variety)</li>
<li>Plum</li>
<li>Pine</li>
<li>Chrysanthemum</li>
<li>Dwarf Bamboo Grass</li>
</ul>
<p>Since it was year-end, I made something for New Year&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The largest scale ever.</p>
<p>To synchronize the plum&rsquo;s blooming time with the others, apparently you should keep it indoors at about 15°C for a while after the buds appear.</p>
<p>However, sadly, when I covered the Coral Ardisia with a plastic bag as bird protection and went back to my parents&rsquo; house, the birds apparently removed it - the plastic bag was gone and the berries had been eaten.
Birds are quite clever, aren&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>So I didn&rsquo;t try to synchronize the blooming times.</p>

Despite being such a large group planting, everything is healthy and has become an annual spring joy.</p>
